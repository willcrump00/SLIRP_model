% function to compute the increase in icidence of a plant pathogen (or any
% pathogen with stationary hosts).  This code is 2-D because it predicts 
% the growth of the pathogen for a 2-D array of hosts each with a 
% population that grows in size with time.  Additionally, it calculates 
% airborne transmission of disease between hosts in the 2D array.  It is 
% a modified version of the PathogenGrowth_0D function used in lab 09.
%
% The primary equations governing this are compound interest equations for
% growth:
%
% dS/dt = -beta*S*I+dP/dt
%
% dL/dt = beta*S*I-mu_L*L+dE/dt
%
% dI/dt = mu_L*L*I-mu_I*I
%
% dP/dt = dB/dt + d(leaf)/dt 
%
% dR/dt = mu_I*I
%
% dE/dt = e
%
% dF/dt = Gamma*exp(alpha*I) - F*R_frac
%
% with:
% S    = susceptible fraction of population (susceptible tissue)
% beta = rate of infection growth for healthy population (fraction per day)
% L    = fraction of tissue infected and latent (e.g., dormant before infection)
% I    = fraction of tissue infected and producing inoculum
% R    = fraction of tissue recovered (or removed) from population
% P    = size of the total population (plant surface area)
% B    = surface area of berries
% E    = amount (fraction of population) of introduced disease from external sources
% F    = size of the spreading population, e.g. sporulating for a fungus 
% t    = time
% mu_L = rate of decrease in latent population (fraction per day)
% mu_I = rate of decrease in infectious population (fraction per day)
% e    = rate of import from external sources
%
% inputs: vine (structure containing the initial size of susceptible population); beta; mu;
% tspan (days to simulate array);
% output: S,L,I,R,P,E,time (vector of simulation times), and B
