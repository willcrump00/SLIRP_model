will crump - 12/8/23


added and updated rk4 function
added e & f function derivatives to SLIRPE function
** note ****************** not implemented
e function should be our gaussian plume function
-- need to identify position x,y we are using 
presumably from the index of plant we are going over which 
will be my working presumption
-assumed that dep_area is area of entire orchard as it is used to find deposition length
of spores in g-plume  (wrote Npx*Npy -- length of x*y) 50*50 plants each plant 1m long and wide
**************************
decided that e is calculated elsewhere because parameters are not passed, however parameters for f were passed
set dydt(7) = e;

added R_frac value fpr dydt(8)
assumed M = m_used - unsure noted
sure on xi and eta value

added mean calculations to pathodrive
added F - dydt8 -

started writing scouting function
changed alpha * AP as per notes

-----------------collected data ---------------------
min infection size .0159mm 
drone speed required to detect that - 0.000795m/s = .047m/min = 2.862m/hr (max)
solve 2 = .047 * x = 43 minutes of searching = 100 * .716 = $71.6 for 2 plants
max of 24 plants searched with 12 drones = $859

cost breakdown for days 10 - 15
if scouting every day
$859 - if no infected
$1859 - infected and not found
$859 * days - if infected is found - min cost

probability of finding within first 5 days
24 * 5 / 2500 = 4.8%
discuss risk to reward ratio

for days 15-20 infected plants is usually 1-2 at this time (takes about 5 days for infected pop to double)
min infection size = 0.0208 mm - .06mm (day 20)
drone speed required to detect
day 15 = .0208 = 20x (spd = .001m/s)
day 20 = .06 = 20x (spd = .003m/s)

detection stats
day 15 - max plants = 3.6 plants per hr
cost for 3 plants = 100*.833 = 83.3$
max 12 drones searching - we can scan 36 plants per - 999$

cost breakdown
if no infected for first 15 days & searched - none found infected around day 15
($859 * 5 )(scouting for first 5 days) + ($1000 * 5) + ($1000*5) = $14295
probability of finding infected plants
120 + 36*5 / 2500 = 12% chance

cost if no drones run during this time assuming average start time of infection at 13 days and 
2 infected at 18 days
min cost seen = $3000
max cost seen = $inf essentially
$5000 + $4000 = $9000
cost benefit analysis
12% chance at detection == ~$5300 


after 2 plants have been infected the infection rate shoots up exponentially
day 15 =2 day 20 =200

-added a script for making movies with our population data
-added an if statement to the pathogen growth function that allows it to 
only simulate a certain number of days. this will help speed up testing and
troubleshooting instead of having to wait an hour for it to run the whole sim
-added a save function at the bottom of the driver script to save all the simulation
data so that you dont have to rerun the sim each time you need to make code changes, just load the MAT file
